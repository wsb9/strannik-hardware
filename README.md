Hardware sources of Strannik, ortholinear wireless keyboard.

ZMK config is in [peer software repo](https://github.com/wsb9/strannik).

# About

This project inspired by awesome [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander). 
At the time of start, ZSA guys haven't yet made Voyager, and I wanted very similar 
low profile wireless keyboard, so, this project had a great initial kick.

It currently uses Kailh Choc low profile switches, [NiceNano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano) as its brain and [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) as firmware.

Current plan is to make project usable in daily use (instead of cardboard wired prototype).

# Future plans

There's few ideas:

 - make even thinner keeb based on Kailh notebook switches
 - create version with large batteries and backlight
 - probably create version with encoder on the edge
